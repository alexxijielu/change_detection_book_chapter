# Change Detection Tutorial

This repository contains demo code as a companion to our forthcoming book chapter "Using dimensionality reduction to
visualize phenotypic changes in high-throughput microscopy". The Jupyter Notebook "change_detection.ipynb" 
guides you through an end-to-end pipeline that enables the systematic, automated detection of protein localization 
changes in high-content microscopy screens, using the yeast GFP collection after hydroxyurea treatment as an example.

Data required to run this demo can be found on our Zenodo upload linked here:
